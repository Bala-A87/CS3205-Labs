# Lab 3

## Language coded in

Python

## Directory structure

- [crc.py](./crc.py): main file handling CRC computation and error checks
- [gen_inp.py](./gen_inp.py): helper file to generate sample inputs
- [sample_input.txt](./sample_input.txt): file with sample input test cases
- [sample_output.txt](./sample_output.txt): file with outputs corresponding to test cases

## Executing code

`python3 crc.py <infile> <outfile>` <br>
where \<infile\> is the file containing the test case inputs and \<outfile\> is the file where outputs are printed.

Sample test cases can be generated by running <br>
`python3 gen_inp.py <testfile> <num_inputs> <len_inputs>` <br>
where \<testfile\> is the file where the sample test case inputs are stored, \<num_inputs\> is the number of test cases and \<len_inputs\> is the length of each test case.

Example input file is provided in sample_input.txt, and corresponding outputs in sample_output.txt
